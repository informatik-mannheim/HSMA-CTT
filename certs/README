The certificate in this directory is self-signed, it is only intended for development and testing of the application.
A new self-signed certificate can be generated by anyone running the gen-self-signed.sh script.

Do NOT use this certificate publicly as it is inherently unsafe and browsers will rightfully complain about it.
